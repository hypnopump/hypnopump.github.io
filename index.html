Be water, my friend.

Don’t get set into one form
adapt it and build your own, 
and let it grow,
be like water.

Empty your mind, 
be formless,
shapeless -
like water. 

Now you put water in a cup,
it becomes the cup;
You put water into a bottle,
it becomes the bottle;
You put it in a teapot,
it becomes the teapot.

Now water can flow
or it can crash. 
Be water, my friend. 


Roses are red, violets are blue.
Being original, that's what I do.
